## Required Software
- SWI-Prolog
    - Tested on 9.0.4 for Windows
- Coq
    - Tested on 8.18.0 for Windows
    - Make sure that the location of `coqtop` is added to the `PATH` environment variable
- A browser to view the web app
    - Any should do, though most testing was done using Chromium browsers

## Usage
- To start the server, run `swipl` from the `app` folder, and execute `[server].`
- Visit the front end at http://localhost:8000/
- Type the rules and narrative in the left text area.
    - Events are introduced to the narrative by `happens/2`
    - Standard `initially/1`, `initiates/3`, `terminates/3`, `releases/3` Event Calculus predicates are available for manipulating non-veracity fluents
    - For veracity fluents:
        - set_judgement(Event, Actor, Evidence, Claim, Confidence)
        - set_trust(Event, Trustor, Trustee, Trust_Level)
    - **Note:** See the `example` folder for example input code
- When finished writing the code, click `Generate Narrative`. It may take a few seconds for the response to arrive, as Coq is reset between sessions.
- If an error is returned:
    - The server's execution may be blocked; the server needs to be restarted in that case.
    - There may be syntax errors; check the terminal output.
- The `Timeline` slider can be used to move through the narrative, with the rest of the output display dynamically changing to reflect this.
- `Events at this timestamp` and `Fluents just after this timestamp` show the raw Event Calculus output for this timestep.
- `Graph display options` allow you to choose which veracity fluents are displayed in the graph display. Judgements are also marked as having passed or failed formal verification.
- After selecting a node in the graph display (located in the bottom right corner), information relating to that node is shown in the `Information for the selected node` area. If a certain type of judgement is selected from the `Graph display options`, then its proof is shown here.

## Software Architecture Diagram
![Depiction of software architecture](architecture.png)
1. The client sends a request to the server to execute some code.
2. The request is received by the server, and the accompanying code is sent to the Event Calculus in order to generate the narrative. Then, the server loops over each timestamp, telling cached_dec.pl to run `tick/0`.
3. At each tick, the DEC handles the fluents and events which aren't related to the Veracity Logic, and calls `veracity_tick/1` located in veracity_logic.pl.
4. This procedure determines which veracity fluents need to be added, updated, or removed.
5. Control is passed to Pfc (through `add/1` and `rem2/1`) for forward chaining. New fluents are derived through inference rules such as trust and implication, and old ones are removed if they no longer have support. <br> At this stage, judgements' proofs are not ground. This is because there could be multiple sources of verification, e.g. `A \/ B -> C`. `C` becomes true when `A` is true, but if `B` is later confirmed, the proof of `C` may need to be recalculated. Therefore, proofs are left non-ground until they need to be formally verified.
6. After all of the changes have been made for a given timestep, the fluents stored in Pfc are extracted (`pfc/1`).
7. Judgements have their proofs grounded (`ground_judgement/2`), and sent to coq_communication.pl for verification (`verify/3`).
8. The intermediate proof representation for each judgement is translated into Coq syntax - in particular, Prolog terms are not all valid Coq syntax so they need to be renamed appropriately.
9. Translated proofs are sent line-by-line to Coq for formal verification via a pipe.
10. After each tactic, success or failure is reported.
11. The overall success of the judgement's proof verification is determined, and the `verify/3` call is exited.
12. Fluents (as well as their verification status) for a given timestep are sent back to the Event Calculus (through `veracity_fluent/1`).
13. All fluents for a given timestamp are extracted from the Event Calculus (through `fluent/2`); from both cached_dec.pl and veracity_logic.pl.
14. The entire narrative is constructed, and translated into JSON before being sent as a response to the client.
15. The response is received and processed by JavaScript to update the DOM.
16. The graph display is updated as needed.
